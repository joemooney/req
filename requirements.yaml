     Keybinding Context System:

      - KeyContext enum with four scopes:
        - Global - Works anywhere (zoom, theme cycling)
        - RequirementsList - Only in the list panel when not typing
        - DetailView - Only when viewing requirement details
        - Form - Only in add/edit forms
      - Each keybinding now has a context that determines where it's active:
        - Navigation keys (Up/Down, Enter, Space) default to RequirementsList
        - Global shortcuts (zoom, theme) default to Global
      - Context is automatically determined based on:
        - If a text field has focus → only Global shortcuts work
        - Otherwise based on current view (List, Detail, Add/Edit)
      - Settings UI updated to show and allow editing context for each keybinding via a dropdown

      This prevents issues like arrow keys navigating the list while typing in a search box, or Enter triggering edit mode when submitting a form.

    # Implementation

      1. User spec_id with $USER-XXX format:
        - Users now get auto-generated IDs like $USER-001, $USER-002, etc.
        - Existing users are automatically migrated on load
      2. Meta-type infrastructure:
        - Added meta_counters HashMap for per-prefix ID generation
        - Defined prefix constants: META_PREFIX_USER, META_PREFIX_VIEW, META_PREFIX_FEATURE
        - Ready for future meta-types like $VIEW-XXX, $FEAT-XXX
      3. User-to-Requirement relationship types:
        - created_by - User who created the requirement (blue)
        - assigned_to - User assigned to work on it (green)
        - tested_by - User(s) who tested it (orange)
        - closed_by - User who closed/completed it (red)
      4. GUI updates:
        - Users table now shows the $USER-XXX ID column
        - New users get auto-generated IDs
      5. Documentation:
        - Added User Management section to user guide
        - Updated PROMPT_HISTORY.md

      Future considerations for Phase 2:
      - Add a filter toggle in the list view to show/hide meta-types
      - Implement the user relationship assignment UI (dropdown to select $USER-XXX when creating relationships)
      - Consider promoting Features to $FEAT-XXX and Views to $VIEW-XXX

            - Defined prefix constants: META_PREFIX_USER, META_PREFIX_VIEW, META_PREFIX_FEATURE
            - Ready for future meta-types like $VIEW-XXX, $FEAT-XXX
          3. User-to-Requirement relationship types:
            - created_by - User who created the requirement (blue)
            - assigned_to - User assigned to work on it (green)
            - tested_by - User(s) who tested it (orange)
            - closed_by - User who closed/completed it (red)
          4. GUI updates:
            - Users table now shows the $USER-XXX ID column
            - New users get auto-generated IDs
          5. Documentation:
            - Added User Management section to user guide
            - Updated PROMPT_HISTORY.md

          Future considerations for Phase 2:
          - Add a filter toggle in the list view to show/hide meta-types
          - Implement the user relationship assignment UI (dropdown to select $USER-XXX when creating relationships)
          - Consider promoting Features to $FEAT-XXX and Views to $VIEW-XXX

  title: Filtering view of requirements
  description: |
    I think in filtering it may be worth having two levels. So when you click Filters you get two tabs, one for root and one for children. The
      root option filters the first level of requirements that are selected, and the children applies to which children are shown recursively. In
      children there is a checkbox, <same as root> which greys out everthing or hides them (that would be the same as what we currently have, one
      set of filters across all requirements). The purpose of this is to limit the scope of the top level requirements that we want to drill down
      into.
    Two-Level Filter System (Root/Children)

      The filter panel now has two tabs:
      - Root tab: Filters for top-level requirements in tree views
      - Children tab: Filters for nested requirements with a "Same as root" checkbox

      Key changes:
      1. Added FilterTab enum and child filter fields (child_filter_types, child_filter_features, child_filter_prefixes, children_same_as_root)
      2. Updated show_filter_controls() to display tabbed UI with Root/Children selection
      3. Created show_root_filter_controls() and show_children_filter_controls() functions
      4. Updated passes_filters() to accept an is_root parameter that determines which filter set to use
      5. Updated all callers to pass appropriate is_root values:
        - Root-level items (find_tree_roots, find_tree_leaves, flat lists): is_root=true
        - Child items (get_children, get_parents): is_root=false
      6. Updated ViewPreset to persist child filter settings
      7. Updated documentation (user-guide.md, OVERVIEW.md, PROMPT_HISTORY.md)

      Usage:
      - By default, "Same as root" is checked, so all requirements use the same filters (existing behavior)
      - Uncheck "Same as root" in the Children tab to set independent filters for children
      - This allows scenarios like "show only Functional Requirements at root, but display all their children"

Currently the Type Definitions tab in Settings is read-only - it just displays the built-in types. Adding an editor\n  would allow users to:\n\n  1.

  description: |
    Ctrl-C copy in a textbox or whenever text is selected should copy the text into the system clipboard and secondard buffer. I do a middle click
      paste elsewhere and it is not pasting in what I copied. Perhaps this is an behavior option if what I am asking for is non-standard. Not sure
      if this makes sense

    There is a known limitation of egui - it doesn't sync to the X11 primary selection (middle-click buffer) when you copy text. There's an
      https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5852 in egui for this.

      The workaround would be to add the arboard crate and manually sync to the primary selection. However, this is tricky because:

      1. We'd need to intercept Ctrl+C before egui handles it
      2. We'd need to know what text is currently selected in the TextEdit widget
      3. egui doesn't expose a TextSelectionChanged event (there's https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/7273 for this)

      Options:
      1. Wait for egui to add support - The underlying arboard crate already supports primary selection, but egui hasn't integrated it yet
      2. Add a workaround - We could try to detect Ctrl+C and sync egui's clipboard to the primary selection using arboard, but we wouldn't be
      able to sync on text selection alone (only on explicit copy)

      Would you like me to attempt option 2? It won't give you the full "select text = primary selection" behavior that X11 apps typically have,
      but it would at least make Ctrl+C copy to both the clipboard AND the primary selection buffer, so middle-click paste would work after you
      explicitly copy.

    implemented the right-click context menu with Cut/Copy/Paste functionality. Here's what was added:

      Features:
      - Right-click context menu on text fields with:
        - ✂ Cut - cuts selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
        - 📋 Copy - copies selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
        - 📥 Paste - pastes from clipboard
        - Select All - selects all text in the field

      Linux Primary Selection Support:
      - When you use Copy or Cut (either via right-click menu or Ctrl+C), the text is copied to both:
        a. The regular clipboard (Ctrl+V paste)
        b. The X11 primary selection (middle-click paste)

      This means after copying text in req-gui, you can now middle-click paste it into other applications.

      Applied to:
      - Requirement Title field
      - Requirement Description field
      - Comment Content field

      The context menu can be easily added to other text fields as needed - just call add_text_edit_context_menu() after any TextEdit widget.

      Sources:
      - https://users.rust-lang.org/t/egui-right-click-menu/97569
      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/1321
      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/5785

    The solution captures the text selection on secondary_down (when you press the right mouse button) BEFORE the click
      event clears the selection. This stored selection is then used when you click Cut or Copy in the context menu.

      Key changes:
      1. Added TextSelection struct to store: selected text, start/end positions, and widget ID
      2. Added last_text_selection field to RequirementsApp
      3. Capture selection on response.hovered() && ui.input(|i| i.pointer.secondary_down())
      4. Use the stored selection for Cut/Copy operations

      You can now:
      1. Select text in a field
      2. Right-click
      3. The selection is preserved and Copy/Cut should work

          - Right-click context menu on text fields with:
            - ✂ Cut - cuts selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
            - 📋 Copy - copies selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
            - 📥 Paste - pastes from clipboard
            - Select All - selects all text in the field

          Linux Primary Selection Support:
          - When you use Copy or Cut (either via right-click menu or Ctrl+C), the text is copied to both:
            a. The regular clipboard (Ctrl+V paste)
            b. The X11 primary selection (middle-click paste)

          This means after copying text in req-gui, you can now middle-click paste it into other applications.

          Applied to:
          - Requirement Title field
          - Requirement Description field
          - Comment Content field

          The context menu can be easily added to other text fields as needed - just call add_text_edit_context_menu() after any TextEdit widget.

        Ctrl-C copy in a textbox or whenever text is selected should copy the text into the system clipboard and secondard buffer. I do a middle click
          paste elsewhere and it is not pasting in what I copied. Perhaps this is an behavior option if what I am asking for is non-standard. Not sure
          if this makes sense

        There is a known limitation of egui - it doesn't sync to the X11 primary selection (middle-click buffer) when you copy text. There's an
          https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5852 in egui for this.

          The workaround would be to add the arboard crate and manually sync to the primary selection. However, this is tricky because:

          1. We'd need to intercept Ctrl+C before egui handles it
          2. We'd need to know what text is currently selected in the TextEdit widget
          3. egui doesn't expose a TextSelectionChanged event (there's https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/7273 for this)

          Options:
          1. Wait for egui to add support - The underlying arboard crate already supports primary selection, but egui hasn't integrated it yet
          2. Add a workaround - We could try to detect Ctrl+C and sync egui's clipboard to the primary selection using arboard, but we wouldn't be
          able to sync on text selection alone (only on explicit copy)

          Would you like me to attempt option 2? It won't give you the full "select text = primary selection" behavior that X11 apps typically have,
          but it would at least make Ctrl+C copy to both the clipboard AND the primary selection buffer, so middle-click paste would work after you
          explicitly copy.

        The solution captures the text selection on secondary_down (when you press the right mouse button) BEFORE the click
          event clears the selection. This stored selection is then used when you click Cut or Copy in the context menu.

          Key changes:
          1. Added TextSelection struct to store: selected text, start/end positions, and widget ID
          2. Added last_text_selection field to RequirementsApp
          3. Capture selection on response.hovered() && ui.input(|i| i.pointer.secondary_down())
          4. Use the stored selection for Cut/Copy operations

          You can now:
          1. Select text in a field
          2. Right-click
          3. The selection is preserved and Copy/Cut should work
