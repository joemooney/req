     Keybinding Context System:

      - KeyContext enum with four scopes:
        - Global - Works anywhere (zoom, theme cycling)
        - RequirementsList - Only in the list panel when not typing
        - DetailView - Only when viewing requirement details
        - Form - Only in add/edit forms
      - Each keybinding now has a context that determines where it's active:
        - Navigation keys (Up/Down, Enter, Space) default to RequirementsList
        - Global shortcuts (zoom, theme) default to Global
      - Context is automatically determined based on:
        - If a text field has focus → only Global shortcuts work
        - Otherwise based on current view (List, Detail, Add/Edit)
      - Settings UI updated to show and allow editing context for each keybinding via a dropdown

      This prevents issues like arrow keys navigating the list while typing in a search box, or Enter triggering edit mode when submitting a form.

  title: User meta type
  description: |2


      1. User spec_id with $USER-XXX format:
        - Users now get auto-generated IDs like $USER-001, $USER-002, etc.
        - Existing users are automatically migrated on load
      2. Meta-type infrastructure:
        - Added meta_counters HashMap for per-prefix ID generation
        - Defined prefix constants: META_PREFIX_USER, META_PREFIX_VIEW, META_PREFIX_FEATURE
        - Ready for future meta-types like $VIEW-XXX, $FEAT-XXX
      3. User-to-Requirement relationship types:
        - created_by - User who created the requirement (blue)
        - assigned_to - User assigned to work on it (green)
        - tested_by - User(s) who tested it (orange)
        - closed_by - User who closed/completed it (red)
      4. GUI updates:
        - Users table now shows the $USER-XXX ID column
        - New users get auto-generated IDs
      5. Documentation:
        - Added User Management section to user guide
        - Updated PROMPT_HISTORY.md

      Future considerations for Phase 2:
      - Add a filter toggle in the list view to show/hide meta-types
      - Implement the user relationship assignment UI (dropdown to select $USER-XXX when creating relationships)
      - Consider promoting Features to $FEAT-XXX and Views to $VIEW-XXX
