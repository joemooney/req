  title: In Add or Edit, ESC should cancel
  description: |
    In Add or Edit, ESC should cancel if we have not made any  changes, if we have then bring up a confirmation dialog to confirm cancel.

     ESC key handling for the Add/Edit forms:

      Features:
      - ESC cancels immediately if no changes have been made to the form
      - Shows confirmation dialog if there are unsaved changes with options to "Discard Changes" or "Continue Editing"
      - ESC while dialog is open closes the dialog (continues editing)
      - The Cancel button uses the same logic as ESC

      The implementation tracks original form values when entering Add/Edit mode and compares them against current values to detect changes. This
      applies to all form fields: title, description, status, priority, type, owner, feature, tags, prefix, and custom fields.

     Keybinding Context System:

      - KeyContext enum with four scopes:
        - Global - Works anywhere (zoom, theme cycling)
        - RequirementsList - Only in the list panel when not typing
        - DetailView - Only when viewing requirement details
        - Form - Only in add/edit forms
      - Each keybinding now has a context that determines where it's active:
        - Navigation keys (Up/Down, Enter, Space) default to RequirementsList
        - Global shortcuts (zoom, theme) default to Global
      - Context is automatically determined based on:
        - If a text field has focus → only Global shortcuts work
        - Otherwise based on current view (List, Detail, Add/Edit)
      - Settings UI updated to show and allow editing context for each keybinding via a dropdown

      This prevents issues like arrow keys navigating the list while typing in a search box, or Enter triggering edit mode when submitting a form.

    # Implementation

      1. User spec_id with $USER-XXX format:
        - Users now get auto-generated IDs like $USER-001, $USER-002, etc.
        - Existing users are automatically migrated on load
      2. Meta-type infrastructure:
        - Added meta_counters HashMap for per-prefix ID generation
        - Defined prefix constants: META_PREFIX_USER, META_PREFIX_VIEW, META_PREFIX_FEATURE
        - Ready for future meta-types like $VIEW-XXX, $FEAT-XXX
      3. User-to-Requirement relationship types:
        - created_by - User who created the requirement (blue)

  title: Custom type definitions
  description: |
    Custom Type Definitions System Implemented:

      1. Core Models (requirements-core/src/models.rs):
        - Added CustomFieldType enum with 8 field types (Text, TextArea, Select, Boolean, Date, User, Requirement, Number)
        - Added CustomFieldDefinition struct for defining custom fields
        - Added CustomTypeDefinition struct for defining requirement types
        - Added type_definitions to RequirementsStore with default built-in types
        - Added custom_status and custom_fields to Requirement struct

      required)
      3. GUI Updates (requirements-gui/src/app.rs):
        - Form now uses type-specific status dropdown
        - When type changes, available statuses update dynamically
        - Custom fields section appears when a type has custom fields
        - Supports all field types with appropriate UI controls
        - Added "📝 Types" settings tab to view configured type definitions
      4. Documentation Updated:
        - Updated user-guide.md with Type Definitions section

  title: Filtering view of requirements
  description: |
    I think in filtering it may be worth having two levels. So when you click Filters you get two tabs, one for root and one for children. The
      root option filters the first level of requirements that are selected, and the children applies to which children are shown recursively. In
      children there is a checkbox, <same as root> which greys out everthing or hides them (that would be the same as what we currently have, one
      set of filters across all requirements). The purpose of this is to limit the scope of the top level requirements that we want to drill down
      into.
    Two-Level Filter System (Root/Children)

      The filter panel now has two tabs:
      - Root tab: Filters for top-level requirements in tree views
      - Children tab: Filters for nested requirements with a "Same as root" checkbox

      Key changes:
      1. Added FilterTab enum and child filter fields (child_filter_types, child_filter_features, child_filter_prefixes, children_same_as_root)
      2. Updated show_filter_controls() to display tabbed UI with Root/Children selection
      3. Created show_root_filter_controls() and show_children_filter_controls() functions
      4. Updated passes_filters() to accept an is_root parameter that determines which filter set to use
      5. Updated all callers to pass appropriate is_root values:
        - Root-level items (find_tree_roots, find_tree_leaves, flat lists): is_root=true
        - Child items (get_children, get_parents): is_root=false
      6. Updated ViewPreset to persist child filter settings
      7. Updated documentation (user-guide.md, OVERVIEW.md, PROMPT_HISTORY.md)

      Usage:
      - By default, "Same as root" is checked, so all requirements use the same filters (existing behavior)
      - Uncheck "Same as root" in the Children tab to set independent filters for children
      - This allows scenarios like "show only Functional Requirements at root, but display all their children"

        When you click on Links tab, show a button to enter a URL, perhaps a button to verify that it is a valid link.

          External URL Links Feature:

          1. UrlLink Model (requirements-core/src/models.rs):
            - New UrlLink struct with fields: id, url, title, description, added_at, added_by, last_verified, last_verified_ok
            - Added urls: Vec<UrlLink> field to Requirement struct
          2. GUI Integration (requirements-gui/src/app.rs):
            - Updated Links tab to show "External Links" section with "➕ New URL" button
            - URL list displays with:
                - Verification status indicators (✅ valid, ❌ failed)
              - Clickable links that open in browser
              - Edit (✏) and remove (x) buttons
            - URL form modal with:
                - URL input field
              - Optional title and description
              - "🔍 Verify" button to validate URL format
              - Colored status messages for validation results
            - Links tab count now shows total of relationships + URLs
          3. Dependencies:
            - Added url = "2" for URL parsing/validation
            - Added open = "5" for opening URLs in browser
          4. Documentation:
            - Updated docs/user-guide.md with Links Tab section

  title: Type Definition Editor
  description: "For the Types in the Settings, does it make sense to have an editor so that we can add/remove/update fields? \n\n● Yes, that makes sense.

Add new custom types - Define entirely new requirement types with custom prefixes, statuses, and fields\n  2. Modify existing types - Add/remove statuses, add/remove custom fields, change descriptions\n  3. Remove custom types - Delete user-defined types (though built-in types could be protected or just resettable)\n\n  Before I implement this, I have a few questions to clarify the design:\n                                                                                                                                             \n● User answered Claude's questions:\n  ⎿  · Should users be able to modify the built-in types (Functional, NonFunctional, System, User, ChangeRequest), or only create new custom \n     types? → Modify built-ins\n     · What happens to existing requirements when a type definition is changed? → Validate on save\n  Type Definition Editor Features:\n\n  1.

  title: Markdown help
  description: |
    The "Supports Markdown" when clicked should show a modal of help or open a browswer page with help on what markdown is supported with
      examples.

    implemented a Markdown help modal that appears when you click the "Supports Markdown" link in the form view. The modal includes:

      - Headers - #, ##, ### syntax
      - Text Formatting - bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code with visual examples showing the rendered result
      - Lists - ordered and unordered, with nesting support
      - Links - [text](url) syntax
      - Code Blocks - with and without language specification for syntax highlighting
      - Blockquotes - > syntax
      - Horizontal Rules - --- syntax
      - Tables - pipe-based table syntax
      - Task Lists - - [ ] and - [x] checkbox syntax

      The modal is a centered, resizable window with a scrollable content area and a Close button.

     Markdown Heading Sizes:

     Now headings use exponential scaling with a factor of 1.25:

      | Heading | Multiplier | At 14pt base |
      |---------|------------|--------------|
      | H1      | ~3.05x     | ~43pt        |
      | H2      | ~2.44x     | ~34pt        |
      | H3      | ~1.95x     | ~27pt        |
      | H4      | ~1.56x     | ~22pt        |
      | H5      | 1.25x      | ~18pt        |
      | H6      | 1x         | 14pt         |



      The heading sizes scale proportionally when you zoom in/out using Ctrl+/- or Ctrl+MouseWheel. The implementation registers custom named text
       styles ("Heading", "Heading2", etc.) that egui_commonmark uses for rendering markdown headings.

    Ctrl-C copy in a textbox or whenever text is selected should copy the text into the system clipboard and secondard buffer. I do a middle click
      paste elsewhere and it is not pasting in what I copied. Perhaps this is an behavior option if what I am asking for is non-standard. Not sure
      if this makes sense

    There is a known limitation of egui - it doesn't sync to the X11 primary selection (middle-click buffer) when you copy text. There's an
      https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5852 in egui for this.

      The workaround would be to add the arboard crate and manually sync to the primary selection. However, this is tricky because:

      1. We'd need to intercept Ctrl+C before egui handles it
      2. We'd need to know what text is currently selected in the TextEdit widget
      3. egui doesn't expose a TextSelectionChanged event (there's https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/7273 for this)

      Options:
      1. Wait for egui to add support - The underlying arboard crate already supports primary selection, but egui hasn't integrated it yet
      2. Add a workaround - We could try to detect Ctrl+C and sync egui's clipboard to the primary selection using arboard, but we wouldn't be
      able to sync on text selection alone (only on explicit copy)

      Would you like me to attempt option 2? It won't give you the full "select text = primary selection" behavior that X11 apps typically have,
      but it would at least make Ctrl+C copy to both the clipboard AND the primary selection buffer, so middle-click paste would work after you
      explicitly copy.

        - ✂ Cut - cuts selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
        - 📋 Copy - copies selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
        - 📥 Paste - pastes from clipboard
        - Select All - selects all text in the field

      Linux Primary Selection Support:
      - When you use Copy or Cut (either via right-click menu or Ctrl+C), the text is copied to both:
        a. The regular clipboard (Ctrl+V paste)
        b. The X11 primary selection (middle-click paste)

      This means after copying text in req-gui, you can now middle-click paste it into other applications.

      Applied to:
      - Requirement Title field
      - Requirement Description field
      - Comment Content field

      The context menu can be easily added to other text fields as needed - just call add_text_edit_context_menu() after any TextEdit widget.

      Sources:
      - https://users.rust-lang.org/t/egui-right-click-menu/97569
      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/1321
      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/5785

    The solution captures the text selection on secondary_down (when you press the right mouse button) BEFORE the click
      event clears the selection. This stored selection is then used when you click Cut or Copy in the context menu.

      Key changes:
      1. Added TextSelection struct to store: selected text, start/end positions, and widget ID
      2. Added last_text_selection field to RequirementsApp
      3. Capture selection on response.hovered() && ui.input(|i| i.pointer.secondary_down())
      4. Use the stored selection for Cut/Copy operations

      You can now:
      1. Select text in a field
      2. Right-click
      3. The selection is preserved and Copy/Cut should work

        Ctrl-C copy in a textbox or whenever text is selected should copy the text into the system clipboard and secondard buffer. I do a middle click
          paste elsewhere and it is not pasting in what I copied. Perhaps this is an behavior option if what I am asking for is non-standard. Not sure
          if this makes sense

        There is a known limitation of egui - it doesn't sync to the X11 primary selection (middle-click buffer) when you copy text. There's an
          https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5852 in egui for this.

          The workaround would be to add the arboard crate and manually sync to the primary selection. However, this is tricky because:

          1. We'd need to intercept Ctrl+C before egui handles it
          2. We'd need to know what text is currently selected in the TextEdit widget
          3. egui doesn't expose a TextSelectionChanged event (there's https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/7273 for this)

          Options:
          1. Wait for egui to add support - The underlying arboard crate already supports primary selection, but egui hasn't integrated it yet
          2. Add a workaround - We could try to detect Ctrl+C and sync egui's clipboard to the primary selection using arboard, but we wouldn't be
          able to sync on text selection alone (only on explicit copy)

          Would you like me to attempt option 2? It won't give you the full "select text = primary selection" behavior that X11 apps typically have,
          but it would at least make Ctrl+C copy to both the clipboard AND the primary selection buffer, so middle-click paste would work after you
          explicitly copy.

  description: |2
     1. requirements-core/src/models.rs - Added Hash derive to RequirementStatus and RequirementPriority enums to allow them to be used in
      HashSet for filtering
      2. requirements-gui/src/app.rs - Added:
        - Filter state fields: filter_statuses, filter_priorities, child_filter_statuses, child_filter_priorities (all HashSet types)
        - UI controls for status and priority filters in both root and children filter panels
        - Updated passes_filters() function to check status and priority against the filter sets

      The filtering works as follows:
      - Empty set = show all (no filter applied)
      - Non-empty set = only show requirements matching one of the selected values
      - Filters work independently for root requirements and child requirements

  description: |
    Instead of Archive and Delete have a single Quick Action button dropdown of actions that can be taken on requirement. Have  Priority (which will be a sub-dropdown of possible priorities for that requirement). Also have Status as a sub-dropdown  with possible priorities for that requirement then also in the Status sub-dropdown, a separator if possible, and Archive and Delete actions.

    a single "⚡ Actions" dropdown menu that contains:

      1. Priority submenu - shows High, Medium, Low options with a checkmark (✓) next to the current priority
      2. Status submenu - contains:
        - Status options: Draft, Approved, Completed, Rejected (with checkmark for current)
        - A separator line
        - Archive/Unarchive action (icon changes based on current state)
        - Delete action

      All changes to priority and status are tracked in the requirement's change history, so they appear in the History tab.

Also have Status as a sub-dropdown  with possible priorities for that requirement then also in the Status sub-dropdown, a separator if possible, and Archive and Delete actions.

        a single "⚡ Actions" dropdown menu that contains:

          1. Priority submenu - shows High, Medium, Low options with a checkmark (✓) next to the current priority
          2. Status submenu - contains:
            - Status options: Draft, Approved, Completed, Rejected (with checkmark for current)
            - A separator line
            - Archive/Unarchive action (icon changes based on current state)
            - Delete action

          All changes to priority and status are tracked in the requirement's change history, so they appear in the History tab.

  title: Recursive relationships view
  description: |
    In the Relationships tab, ability to list all immediate relationships (as presently implemented), and a checkbox (recursive) to present a tree structure (children collapsed by default)  - protect against infinite cycles.

    Do not display a requirement that is already displayed, that is, parent ->child->parent (do not show this same parent again.). For a reciprocal relationship this is not really a cycle. If parent/child was M:N so that multiple parents could share a child then we should not show the other parents but indicate that there are additional relationships we are not recursing into, say an up arrow and "shared". And keep cycle for real (and probably problematic cycles). If we loop back to to a previous requirement through a different relationship (e.g. references) show an icon to indicate bidirectional relationship (maybe a two ended arrow). We should be able to double click on this to take us to the other requiment.

      1. Reciprocal relationships (e.g., parent→child→parent): Don't show the same requirement twice in a branch. This isn't really a cycle, just
      the inverse relationship - skip silently.
      2. Shared children (M:N): If a child has multiple parents, when viewing from one parent, don't recurse into the other parents. Instead show
      "↑ shared" to indicate there are other parents we're not showing.
      3. True cycles: Actual problematic loops through the same relationship type (rare, likely a data error) - keep the "↻ (cycle)" indicator.
      4. Cross-relationship references: If requirement A references requirement B through a different relationship type (e.g., "references"), show
       a bidirectional arrow (↔) that's double-clickable to navigate there.


    The Relationships section has two modes:

      Immediate View (default, checkbox unchecked):
      - Shows only direct relationships of the current requirement
      - Has the "x" button to delete relationships
      - Original behavior preserved

      Recursive View (checkbox checked):
      - Shows relationships as a tree structure
      - Nodes are collapsed by default - click ▶ to expand, ▼ to collapse
      - Only nodes with children show the expand/collapse button
      - Cycle protection: If a requirement is visited twice in the same path, shows "↻ (cycle)" indicator and stops recursion
      - No delete button in recursive view to avoid confusion with the collapse button
      - Double-click any node to navigate to that requirement

  description: |
    The database should have a name store in the yaml file and it should be used in the Title bar of the Window. You may change the database name in the Settings/Db tab. Likewise there should be a Database Title (oneliner), and a Database Description (multiline)

      1. RequirementsStore model - Added a name field that is stored in the YAML file (with #[serde(default)] for backward compatibility)
      2. Window title - Dynamically updates based on the database name:
        - If name is set: "MyDatabase - Requirements Manager"
        - If name is empty: "Requirements Manager"
      3. Settings/Db tab - Added a "Database Name" section at the top with:
        - A text input field to edit the name
        - Automatically saves when the field loses focus
        - Hint text: "Enter database name (shown in title bar)"


    The database now has three identity fields:

      1. Name - Short identifier (e.g., "PROJ-A")
      2. Title - One-line title for the database
      3. Description - Multi-line detailed description

      Window title logic:
      - If both Name and Title are set: "Name - Title"
      - If only Title is set: "Title"
      - If only Name is set: "Name"
      - If neither is set: "Requirements Manager"

          - If only Name is set: "Name"

  title: scollbar sync with mouse wheel
  description: |2


    ~~in reqlist the mouse scrollwheel and the scrollbar are scolling at different rates so that the selected req is lagging. We need to leap ~~
    forward if the selected req falls behind

     The reqlist now keeps the selected requirement visible when scrolling:

      - When you scroll using the mouse wheel or scrollbar, if the selected requirement goes outside the visible area, it automatically snaps back
       into view
      - Uses TOP alignment when scrolling down (selected item above viewport)
      - Uses BOTTOM alignment when scrolling up (selected item below viewport)

      This prevents the selection from "lagging behind" the scroll position.


      - Mouse wheel: Scrolls the reqlist view without changing selection (standard behavior)
      - Up/Down arrows: Navigate selection and scroll selected item into view
      - PageUp/PageDown: Navigate selection by page
      - Home/End: Jump to first/last item
      - Click: Select an item

    Restart option in the Menu. Here's what was added:

      Restart Feature (Menu → Restart)
      - Detects if running via cargo run by checking if the executable path contains /target/debug/ or /target/release/
      - If running via cargo: spawns cargo run --bin <binary-name> (with --release flag if it was a release build), which will trigger
      recompilation if source files changed
      - If running as a direct executable: restarts the same binary directly
      - Preserves any command-line arguments passed to the application
      - The application closes after spawning the new process
