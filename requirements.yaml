  title: add created by
  description: |2
      Changes to aida-core/src/models.rs:
      1. Added created_by: Option<String> field to the Requirement struct
      2. Added created_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>> and created_by: Option<String> fields to the Relationship struct
      3. Added add_relationship_with_creator() function that accepts an optional creator parameter
      4. Added set_relationship_with_creator() function that accepts an optional creator parameter
      5. The original add_relationship() and set_relationship() functions now delegate to the _with_creator variants with None

      Changes to aida-gui/src/app.rs:
      1. When creating a new requirement, created_by is automatically set to self.user_settings.display_name()
      2. All relationship creation calls now use the _with_creator variants to track who created the relationship

          Changes to aida-core/src/models.rs:
          1. Added created_by: Option<String> field to the Requirement struct
          2. Added created_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>> and created_by: Option<String> fields to the Relationship struct
          3. Added add_relationship_with_creator() function that accepts an optional creator parameter
          4. Added set_relationship_with_creator() function that accepts an optional creator parameter
          5. The original add_relationship() and set_relationship() functions now delegate to the _with_creator variants with None

          Changes to aida-gui/src/app.rs:
          1. When creating a new requirement, created_by is automatically set to self.user_settings.display_name()
          2. All relationship creation calls now use the _with_creator variants to track who created the relationship
          3. The detail view now displays:
            - "Created By:" (if available)
            - "Created:" (date/time)
            - "Modified:" (date/time)
          4. When hovering over a relationship in the Links tab, the tooltip now shows creator info if available

  title: In Add or Edit, ESC should cancel
  description: |
    In Add or Edit, ESC should cancel if we have not made any  changes, if we have then bring up a confirmation dialog to confirm cancel.

     ESC key handling for the Add/Edit forms:

      Features:
      - ESC cancels immediately if no changes have been made to the form
      - Shows confirmation dialog if there are unsaved changes with options to "Discard Changes" or "Continue Editing"
      - ESC while dialog is open closes the dialog (continues editing)
      - The Cancel button uses the same logic as ESC

      The implementation tracks original form values when entering Add/Edit mode and compares them against current values to detect changes. This
      applies to all form fields: title, description, status, priority, type, owner, feature, tags, prefix, and custom fields.

     Keybinding Context System:

      - KeyContext enum with four scopes:
        - Global - Works anywhere (zoom, theme cycling)
        - RequirementsList - Only in the list panel when not typing
        - DetailView - Only when viewing requirement details
        - Form - Only in add/edit forms
      - Each keybinding now has a context that determines where it's active:
        - Navigation keys (Up/Down, Enter, Space) default to RequirementsList
        - Global shortcuts (zoom, theme) default to Global
      - Context is automatically determined based on:
        - If a text field has focus → only Global shortcuts work
        - Otherwise based on current view (List, Detail, Add/Edit)
      - Settings UI updated to show and allow editing context for each keybinding via a dropdown

      This prevents issues like arrow keys navigating the list while typing in a search box, or Enter triggering edit mode when submitting a form.

    # Implementation

      1. User spec_id with $USER-XXX format:
        - Users now get auto-generated IDs like $USER-001, $USER-002, etc.
        - Existing users are automatically migrated on load
      2. Meta-type infrastructure:
        - Added meta_counters HashMap for per-prefix ID generation
        - Defined prefix constants: META_PREFIX_USER, META_PREFIX_VIEW, META_PREFIX_FEATURE
        - Ready for future meta-types like $VIEW-XXX, $FEAT-XXX
      3. User-to-Requirement relationship types:
        - created_by - User who created the requirement (blue)
        - assigned_to - User assigned to work on it (green)
        - tested_by - User(s) who tested it (orange)
        - closed_by - User who closed/completed it (red)
      4. GUI updates:
        - Users table now shows the $USER-XXX ID column
        - New users get auto-generated IDs
      5. Documentation:
        - Added User Management section to user guide
        - Updated PROMPT_HISTORY.md

      Future considerations for Phase 2:
      - Add a filter toggle in the list view to show/hide meta-types
      - Implement the user relationship assignment UI (dropdown to select $USER-XXX when creating relationships)
      - Consider promoting Features to $FEAT-XXX and Views to $VIEW-XXX

      required)
      3. GUI Updates (requirements-gui/src/app.rs):
        - Form now uses type-specific status dropdown
        - When type changes, available statuses update dynamically
        - Custom fields section appears when a type has custom fields
        - Supports all field types with appropriate UI controls
        - Added "📝 Types" settings tab to view configured type definitions
      4. Documentation Updated:
        - Updated user-guide.md with Type Definitions section
        - Updated OVERVIEW.md with custom type definitions feature

  title: filtering custom prefixes
  description: "Filters should also include custom PREFIXes. All of the unique ID Prefix that are entered can be stored in a list. These can also be used to\n filter which requirements are shown. This should be listed in the project administration as well. Possibly, this could be a project admin \nrestricted capability (boolean) whereby the ID Prefix would only from a set of prefixes that the project admin controls and it would be a \ndropdown in the edit/add requirement. But by default a regular user should be able to enter a new one. \n  ID Prefix Filtering and Management:\n\n  1. Core Model Updates (requirements-core/src/models.rs):\n    - Added allowed_prefixes: Vec<String> - list of allowed/known prefixes\n    - Added restrict_prefixes: bool - when true, users must select from allowed list\n    - Added helper methods:\n        - get_used_prefixes() - gets all unique prefixes from existing requirements\n      - get_all_prefixes() - combines allowed + used prefixes\n      - add_allowed_prefix(), remove_allowed_prefix(), is_prefix_allowed()\n  2. GUI Filter Panel:\n    - Added filter_prefixes: HashSet<String> for prefix-based filtering\n    - Updated passes_filters() to check prefix filter\n    - Added \"ID Prefix Filters\" section with checkboxes for each unique prefix\n    - Updated ViewPreset to save/restore prefix filters\n  3. Admin Settings (Settings > Admin > ID Prefix Management):\n    - Toggle to restrict prefixes to allowed list\n    - Shows prefixes currently in use\n    - Add new allowed prefixes with validation (uppercase letters only)\n    - Remove prefixes from allowed list (shows if in use)\n  4. Add/Edit Form:\n    - When restrict_prefixes is enabled: shows dropdown with only allowed prefixes\n    - When unrestricted: shows combo box with existing prefixes + text input for new ones\n    - Auto-adds new prefixes to allowed list when used (unless restricted)\n"

But by default a regular user should be able to enter a new one. \n  ID Prefix Filtering and Management:\n\n  1. Core Model Updates (requirements-core/src/models.rs):\n    - Added allowed_prefixes: Vec<String> - list of allowed/known prefixes\n    - Added restrict_prefixes: bool - when true, users must select from allowed list\n    - Added helper methods:\n        - get_used_prefixes() - gets all unique prefixes from existing requirements\n      - get_all_prefixes() - combines allowed + used prefixes\n      - add_allowed_prefix(), remove_allowed_prefix(), is_prefix_allowed()\n  2. GUI Filter Panel:\n    - Added filter_prefixes: HashSet<String> for prefix-based filtering\n    - Updated passes_filters() to check prefix filter\n    - Added \"ID Prefix Filters\" section with checkboxes for each unique prefix\n    - Updated ViewPreset to save/restore prefix filters\n  3. Admin Settings (Settings > Admin > ID Prefix Management):\n    - Toggle to restrict prefixes to allowed list\n    - Shows prefixes currently in use\n    - Add new allowed prefixes with validation (uppercase letters only)\n    - Remove prefixes from allowed list (shows if in use)\n  4. Add/Edit Form:\n    - When restrict_prefixes is enabled: shows dropdown with only allowed prefixes\n    - When unrestricted: shows combo box with existing prefixes + text input for new ones\n    - Auto-adds new prefixes to allowed list when used (unless restricted)\n"

  title: Filtering view of requirements
  description: |
    I think in filtering it may be worth having two levels. So when you click Filters you get two tabs, one for root and one for children. The
      root option filters the first level of requirements that are selected, and the children applies to which children are shown recursively. In
      children there is a checkbox, <same as root> which greys out everthing or hides them (that would be the same as what we currently have, one
      set of filters across all requirements). The purpose of this is to limit the scope of the top level requirements that we want to drill down
      into.
    Two-Level Filter System (Root/Children)

      The filter panel now has two tabs:
      - Root tab: Filters for top-level requirements in tree views
      - Children tab: Filters for nested requirements with a "Same as root" checkbox

      Key changes:
      1. Added FilterTab enum and child filter fields (child_filter_types, child_filter_features, child_filter_prefixes, children_same_as_root)
      2. Updated show_filter_controls() to display tabbed UI with Root/Children selection
      3. Created show_root_filter_controls() and show_children_filter_controls() functions
      4. Updated passes_filters() to accept an is_root parameter that determines which filter set to use
      5. Updated all callers to pass appropriate is_root values:
        - Root-level items (find_tree_roots, find_tree_leaves, flat lists): is_root=true
        - Child items (get_children, get_parents): is_root=false
      6. Updated ViewPreset to persist child filter settings
      7. Updated documentation (user-guide.md, OVERVIEW.md, PROMPT_HISTORY.md)

      Usage:
      - By default, "Same as root" is checked, so all requirements use the same filters (existing behavior)
      - Uncheck "Same as root" in the Children tab to set independent filters for children
      - This allows scenarios like "show only Functional Requirements at root, but display all their children"

      Committed as 24e6b37 and pushed to GitHub.

  title: Markdown help
  description: |
    The "Supports Markdown" when clicked should show a modal of help or open a browswer page with help on what markdown is supported with
      examples.

    implemented a Markdown help modal that appears when you click the "Supports Markdown" link in the form view. The modal includes:

      - Headers - #, ##, ### syntax
      - Text Formatting - bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code with visual examples showing the rendered result
      - Lists - ordered and unordered, with nesting support
      - Links - [text](url) syntax
      - Code Blocks - with and without language specification for syntax highlighting
      - Blockquotes - > syntax
      - Horizontal Rules - --- syntax
      - Tables - pipe-based table syntax
      - Task Lists - - [ ] and - [x] checkbox syntax

      The modal is a centered, resizable window with a scrollable content area and a Close button.

     Markdown Heading Sizes:

     Now headings use exponential scaling with a factor of 1.25:

      | Heading | Multiplier | At 14pt base |
      |---------|------------|--------------|
      | H1      | ~3.05x     | ~43pt        |
      | H2      | ~2.44x     | ~34pt        |
      | H3      | ~1.95x     | ~27pt        |
      | H4      | ~1.56x     | ~22pt        |
      | H5      | 1.25x      | ~18pt        |
      | H6      | 1x         | 14pt         |



      The heading sizes scale proportionally when you zoom in/out using Ctrl+/- or Ctrl+MouseWheel. The implementation registers custom named text
       styles ("Heading", "Heading2", etc.) that egui_commonmark uses for rendering markdown headings.

        The "Supports Markdown" when clicked should show a modal of help or open a browswer page with help on what markdown is supported with
          examples.

        implemented a Markdown help modal that appears when you click the "Supports Markdown" link in the form view. The modal includes:

          - Headers - #, ##, ### syntax
          - Text Formatting - bold, italic, strikethrough, inline code with visual examples showing the rendered result
          - Lists - ordered and unordered, with nesting support
          - Links - [text](url) syntax
          - Code Blocks - with and without language specification for syntax highlighting
          - Blockquotes - > syntax
          - Horizontal Rules - --- syntax
          - Tables - pipe-based table syntax
          - Task Lists - - [ ] and - [x] checkbox syntax

          The modal is a centered, resizable window with a scrollable content area and a Close button.

         Markdown Heading Sizes:
          - H1 (# Heading): 1.8× base font size
          - H2 (## Heading): 1.5× base font size
          - H3 (### Heading): 1.25× base font size
          - H4 (#### Heading): 1.1× base font size
          - H5 (##### Heading): 1× base font size
          - H6 (###### Heading): 0.9× base font size

          The heading sizes scale proportionally when you zoom in/out using Ctrl+/- or Ctrl+MouseWheel. The implementation registers custom named text
           styles ("Heading", "Heading2", etc.) that egui_commonmark uses for rendering markdown headings.

          |---------|------------|--------------|
          | H1      | ~3.05x     | ~43pt        |
          | H2      | ~2.44x     | ~34pt        |

          | H5      | 1.25x      | ~18pt        |

    Ctrl-C copy in a textbox or whenever text is selected should copy the text into the system clipboard and secondard buffer. I do a middle click
      paste elsewhere and it is not pasting in what I copied. Perhaps this is an behavior option if what I am asking for is non-standard. Not sure
      if this makes sense

    There is a known limitation of egui - it doesn't sync to the X11 primary selection (middle-click buffer) when you copy text. There's an
      https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5852 in egui for this.

      The workaround would be to add the arboard crate and manually sync to the primary selection. However, this is tricky because:

      1. We'd need to intercept Ctrl+C before egui handles it
      2. We'd need to know what text is currently selected in the TextEdit widget
      3. egui doesn't expose a TextSelectionChanged event (there's https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/7273 for this)

      Options:
      1. Wait for egui to add support - The underlying arboard crate already supports primary selection, but egui hasn't integrated it yet
      2. Add a workaround - We could try to detect Ctrl+C and sync egui's clipboard to the primary selection using arboard, but we wouldn't be
      able to sync on text selection alone (only on explicit copy)

      Would you like me to attempt option 2? It won't give you the full "select text = primary selection" behavior that X11 apps typically have,
      but it would at least make Ctrl+C copy to both the clipboard AND the primary selection buffer, so middle-click paste would work after you
      explicitly copy.

    implemented the right-click context menu with Cut/Copy/Paste functionality. Here's what was added:

      Features:
      - Right-click context menu on text fields with:
        - ✂ Cut - cuts selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
        - 📋 Copy - copies selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
        - 📥 Paste - pastes from clipboard
        - Select All - selects all text in the field

      Linux Primary Selection Support:
      - When you use Copy or Cut (either via right-click menu or Ctrl+C), the text is copied to both:
        a. The regular clipboard (Ctrl+V paste)
        b. The X11 primary selection (middle-click paste)

      This means after copying text in req-gui, you can now middle-click paste it into other applications.

      Applied to:
      - Requirement Title field
      - Requirement Description field
      - Comment Content field

      The context menu can be easily added to other text fields as needed - just call add_text_edit_context_menu() after any TextEdit widget.

      Sources:
      - https://users.rust-lang.org/t/egui-right-click-menu/97569
      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/discussions/1321
      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/5785

    The solution captures the text selection on secondary_down (when you press the right mouse button) BEFORE the click
      event clears the selection. This stored selection is then used when you click Cut or Copy in the context menu.

      Key changes:
      1. Added TextSelection struct to store: selected text, start/end positions, and widget ID
      2. Added last_text_selection field to RequirementsApp
      3. Capture selection on response.hovered() && ui.input(|i| i.pointer.secondary_down())
      4. Use the stored selection for Cut/Copy operations

      You can now:
      1. Select text in a field
      2. Right-click
      3. The selection is preserved and Copy/Cut should work

        implemented the right-click context menu with Cut/Copy/Paste functionality. Here's what was added:

          Features:
          - Right-click context menu on text fields with:
            - ✂ Cut - cuts selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
            - 📋 Copy - copies selected text to clipboard (and primary selection on Linux)
            - 📥 Paste - pastes from clipboard
            - Select All - selects all text in the field

          Linux Primary Selection Support:
          - When you use Copy or Cut (either via right-click menu or Ctrl+C), the text is copied to both:
            a. The regular clipboard (Ctrl+V paste)
            b. The X11 primary selection (middle-click paste)

          This means after copying text in req-gui, you can now middle-click paste it into other applications.

          Applied to:
          - Requirement Title field
          - Requirement Description field
          - Comment Content field

          The context menu can be easily added to other text fields as needed - just call add_text_edit_context_menu() after any TextEdit widget.

        Ctrl-C copy in a textbox or whenever text is selected should copy the text into the system clipboard and secondard buffer. I do a middle click
          paste elsewhere and it is not pasting in what I copied. Perhaps this is an behavior option if what I am asking for is non-standard. Not sure
          if this makes sense

        There is a known limitation of egui - it doesn't sync to the X11 primary selection (middle-click buffer) when you copy text. There's an
          https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5852 in egui for this.

          The workaround would be to add the arboard crate and manually sync to the primary selection. However, this is tricky because:

          1. We'd need to intercept Ctrl+C before egui handles it
          2. We'd need to know what text is currently selected in the TextEdit widget
          3. egui doesn't expose a TextSelectionChanged event (there's https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/7273 for this)

          Options:
          1. Wait for egui to add support - The underlying arboard crate already supports primary selection, but egui hasn't integrated it yet
          2. Add a workaround - We could try to detect Ctrl+C and sync egui's clipboard to the primary selection using arboard, but we wouldn't be
          able to sync on text selection alone (only on explicit copy)

          Would you like me to attempt option 2? It won't give you the full "select text = primary selection" behavior that X11 apps typically have,
          but it would at least make Ctrl+C copy to both the clipboard AND the primary selection buffer, so middle-click paste would work after you
          explicitly copy.

        The solution captures the text selection on secondary_down (when you press the right mouse button) BEFORE the click
          event clears the selection. This stored selection is then used when you click Cut or Copy in the context menu.

          Key changes:
          1. Added TextSelection struct to store: selected text, start/end positions, and widget ID
          2. Added last_text_selection field to RequirementsApp
          3. Capture selection on response.hovered() && ui.input(|i| i.pointer.secondary_down())
          4. Use the stored selection for Cut/Copy operations

          You can now:
          1. Select text in a field
          2. Right-click
          3. The selection is preserved and Copy/Cut should work

  title: ability to filter based on status, priority
  description: |2
     1. requirements-core/src/models.rs - Added Hash derive to RequirementStatus and RequirementPriority enums to allow them to be used in
      HashSet for filtering
      2. requirements-gui/src/app.rs - Added:
        - Filter state fields: filter_statuses, filter_priorities, child_filter_statuses, child_filter_priorities (all HashSet types)
        - UI controls for status and priority filters in both root and children filter panels
        - Updated passes_filters() function to check status and priority against the filter sets

      The filtering works as follows:
      - Empty set = show all (no filter applied)
      - Non-empty set = only show requirements matching one of the selected values
      - Filters work independently for root requirements and child requirements

  title: Double cllick Description to enter Edit
  description: |
    Double click Description to enter Edit, and switch focus to the Description textbox.

      What was implemented:
      - Double-clicking on the background area of the Detail view (any empty space not covered by buttons, text, etc.) will now open the Edit form
       for the currently selected requirement
      - The feature is disabled when modals are open (URL form, Reference picker, Add comment form) to prevent unintended edits
      - This works alongside the existing double-click on the Description tab content (which focuses the description field)

      How it works:
      - Uses egui's interact_bg() method to detect clicks on background/empty areas
      - Only triggers when no modal dialogs are open
      - Complements the "✏ Edit" button - just a faster way to start editing

          - Double-clicking on the background area of the Detail view (any empty space not covered by buttons, text, etc.) will now open the Edit form
           for the currently selected requirement
          - The feature is disabled when modals are open (URL form, Reference picker, Add comment form) to prevent unintended edits
          - This works alongside the existing double-click on the Description tab content (which focuses the description field)

          How it works:
          - Uses egui's interact_bg() method to detect clicks on background/empty areas
          - Only triggers when no modal dialogs are open
          - Complements the "✏ Edit" button - just a faster way to start editing

  title: Recursive relationships view
  description: |
    In the Relationships tab, ability to list all immediate relationships (as presently implemented), and a checkbox (recursive) to present a tree structure (children collapsed by default)  - protect against infinite cycles.

    Do not display a requirement that is already displayed, that is, parent ->child->parent (do not show this same parent again.). For a reciprocal relationship this is not really a cycle. If parent/child was M:N so that multiple parents could share a child then we should not show the other parents but indicate that there are additional relationships we are not recursing into, say an up arrow and "shared". And keep cycle for real (and probably problematic cycles). If we loop back to to a previous requirement through a different relationship (e.g. references) show an icon to indicate bidirectional relationship (maybe a two ended arrow). We should be able to double click on this to take us to the other requiment.

      1. Reciprocal relationships (e.g., parent→child→parent): Don't show the same requirement twice in a branch. This isn't really a cycle, just
      the inverse relationship - skip silently.
      2. Shared children (M:N): If a child has multiple parents, when viewing from one parent, don't recurse into the other parents. Instead show
      "↑ shared" to indicate there are other parents we're not showing.
      3. True cycles: Actual problematic loops through the same relationship type (rare, likely a data error) - keep the "↻ (cycle)" indicator.
      4. Cross-relationship references: If requirement A references requirement B through a different relationship type (e.g., "references"), show
       a bidirectional arrow (↔) that's double-clickable to navigate there.


    The Relationships section has two modes:

      Immediate View (default, checkbox unchecked):
      - Shows only direct relationships of the current requirement
      - Has the "x" button to delete relationships
      - Original behavior preserved

      Recursive View (checkbox checked):
      - Shows relationships as a tree structure
      - Nodes are collapsed by default - click ▶ to expand, ▼ to collapse
      - Only nodes with children show the expand/collapse button
      - Cycle protection: If a requirement is visited twice in the same path, shows "↻ (cycle)" indicator and stops recursion
      - No delete button in recursive view to avoid confusion with the collapse button
      - Double-click any node to navigate to that requirement

    The database should have a name store in the yaml file and it should be used in the Title bar of the Window. You may change the database name in the Settings/Db tab. Likewise there should be a Database Title (oneliner), and a Database Description (multiline)

      1. RequirementsStore model - Added a name field that is stored in the YAML file (with #[serde(default)] for backward compatibility)
      2. Window title - Dynamically updates based on the database name:
        - If name is set: "MyDatabase - Requirements Manager"
        - If name is empty: "Requirements Manager"
      3. Settings/Db tab - Added a "Database Name" section at the top with:
        - A text input field to edit the name
        - Automatically saves when the field loses focus
        - Hint text: "Enter database name (shown in title bar)"


    The database now has three identity fields:

      1. Name - Short identifier (e.g., "PROJ-A")
      2. Title - One-line title for the database
      3. Description - Multi-line detailed description

      Window title logic:
      - If both Name and Title are set: "Name - Title"
      - If only Title is set: "Title"
      - If only Name is set: "Name"
      - If neither is set: "Requirements Manager"

            - Automatically saves when the field loses focus
            - Hint text: "Enter database name (shown in title bar)"


        The database now has three identity fields:

          1. Name - Short identifier (e.g., "PROJ-A")
          2. Title - One-line title for the database
          3. Description - Multi-line detailed description

          Window title logic:
          - If both Name and Title are set: "Name - Title"
          - If only Title is set: "Title"
          - If only Name is set: "Name"
          - If neither is set: "Requirements Manager"

  title: scollbar sync with mouse wheel
  description: |2


    ~~in reqlist the mouse scrollwheel and the scrollbar are scolling at different rates so that the selected req is lagging. We need to leap ~~
    forward if the selected req falls behind

     The reqlist now keeps the selected requirement visible when scrolling:

      - When you scroll using the mouse wheel or scrollbar, if the selected requirement goes outside the visible area, it automatically snaps back
       into view
      - Uses TOP alignment when scrolling down (selected item above viewport)
      - Uses BOTTOM alignment when scrolling up (selected item below viewport)

      This prevents the selection from "lagging behind" the scroll position.


      - Mouse wheel: Scrolls the reqlist view without changing selection (standard behavior)
      - Up/Down arrows: Navigate selection and scroll selected item into view
      - PageUp/PageDown: Navigate selection by page
      - Home/End: Jump to first/last item
      - Click: Select an item

    Restart option in the Menu. Here's what was added:

      Restart Feature (Menu → Restart)
      - Detects if running via cargo run by checking if the executable path contains /target/debug/ or /target/release/
      - If running via cargo: spawns cargo run --bin <binary-name> (with --release flag if it was a release build), which will trigger
      recompilation if source files changed
      - If running as a direct executable: restarts the same binary directly
      - Preserves any command-line arguments passed to the application
      - The application closes after spawning the new process

  title: Reference relation
  description: |
    In Links tab add a button for `+ Reference` which will open a modal with a search box that will perform a full fuzzy search for and show a
      list of requirements to select from and wither double click or select and Link (button) to create the reference relationship.

    Reference picker feature to the Links tab:

      What was implemented:
      - A new "+ Reference" button in the Links tab → Relationships section
      - Clicking it opens a modal with:
        - A search box with auto-focus for fuzzy searching
        - Searches across spec ID, title, and description (case-insensitive contains matching)
        - Shows up to 50 matching requirements
        - Each item displays the spec ID and title
        - Hovering shows status and truncated description
        - Already-referenced requirements and self are filtered out

      How to use:
      1. Click "+ Reference" button
      2. Type to filter the list (or leave empty to see all)
      3. Either:
        - Double-click a requirement to immediately create the reference
        - Single-click to select, then click "Link" button
      4. Click "Cancel" to close without creating a reference

      - Clicking it spawns a new instance of the application

      Implementation:
      - Added open_new_window() function that spawns a new process
      - Works in both development mode (via cargo run) and production mode (direct executable)
      - Passes through any command-line arguments to the new window
      - The new window opens independently, allowing users to:
        - Switch to a different project in the new window
        - Work with the same project in parallel (e.g., different requirements selected)
        - Compare requirements side-by-side

  title: Details View layout
  description: |
    Details View Panel should display with the tabs (Description. Links etc.) at the bottom of the panel when the Details View panel is displayed on the right (as currently implemented). But if the Details View panel is displayed at the bottom (in in List/Details) then a better use of space is to split the Details View panel so that the ID, Type, Status and other non-wide fields are displayed in a vertical column on the left and on the right side of the panel we show the tabs.

      Implemented responsive detail view layout based on orientation:

      1. Added is_details_stacked() method to LayoutMode enum (line 1533) that returns true for
      ListDetailsStacked and SplitListDetails layouts where details are displayed at the bottom.
      2. Modified show_detail_view_internal() to accept a stacked parameter that determines the layout
      orientation.
      3. Modified show_detail_view_with_close() to pass the correct stacked value based on
      layout_mode.is_details_stacked().
      4. Implemented two different layouts:

        - Side layout (right): Traditional vertical layout with metadata grid at top, tabs below, and tab
      content at bottom - unchanged from before.
        - Stacked layout (bottom): New horizontal split layout with:
            - Left column: Metadata fields (ID, Status, Priority, Type, Feature, Owner, Tags, Created By,
      Created, Modified) in a scrollable grid
          - Right column: Compact tab bar (📄 Desc, 💬 (n), 🔗 (n), 📜 (n)) with tab content below

      This improves space utilization in stacked layouts ("List/Details" and "List|List/Details") where
      horizontal space is more abundant than vertical space.

      The GUI is running - you can test by:
      1. Opening the app and clicking the layout button to cycle to "List / Details" mode
      2. Select a requirement and observe the horizontal split in the details panel
      3. Compare with "List | Details" mode which uses the traditional vertical layout

    updated the stacked detail view layout with:

      1. Resizable split - Uses egui::SidePanel with .resizable(true) for the metadata fields on the left
      2. 25%/75% default split - Metadata panel defaults to 25% width, tabs get 75%
      3. Draggable divider - You can drag the divider between the two sections to resize
      4. Min/max constraints - Metadata panel has minimum 150px and maximum 50% of available width
      5. Full tab labels - Since there's more space now, restored full tab labels like "📄 Description"
      instead of "📄 Desc"

      The GUI is running - you can test by:
      1. Switching to "List / Details" layout (stacked mode)
      2. Select a requirement
      3. Drag the vertical divider between the metadata fields and tabs to resize

      old_value: Details View Panel should display with the tabs (Description. Links etc.) at the bottom of the panel when the Details View panel is displayed on the right (as currently implemented). But if the Details View panel is displayed at the bottom (in in List/Details) then a better use of space is to split the Details View panel so that the ID, Type, Status and other non-wide fields are displayed in a vertical column on the left and on the right side of the panel we show the tabs.

        Details View Panel should display with the tabs (Description. Links etc.) at the bottom of the panel when the Details View panel is displayed on the right (as currently implemented). But if the Details View panel is displayed at the bottom (in in List/Details) then a better use of space is to split the Details View panel so that the ID, Type, Status and other non-wide fields are displayed in a vertical column on the left and on the right side of the panel we show the tabs.

          Implemented responsive detail view layout based on orientation:

          1. Added is_details_stacked() method to LayoutMode enum (line 1533) that returns true for
          ListDetailsStacked and SplitListDetails layouts where details are displayed at the bottom.
          2. Modified show_detail_view_internal() to accept a stacked parameter that determines the layout
          orientation.
          3. Modified show_detail_view_with_close() to pass the correct stacked value based on
          layout_mode.is_details_stacked().
          4. Implemented two different layouts:

            - Side layout (right): Traditional vertical layout with metadata grid at top, tabs below, and tab
          content at bottom - unchanged from before.
            - Stacked layout (bottom): New horizontal split layout with:
                - Left column: Metadata fields (ID, Status, Priority, Type, Feature, Owner, Tags, Created By,
          Created, Modified) in a scrollable grid
              - Right column: Compact tab bar (📄 Desc, 💬 (n), 🔗 (n), 📜 (n)) with tab content below

          This improves space utilization in stacked layouts ("List/Details" and "List|List/Details") where
          horizontal space is more abundant than vertical space.

          The GUI is running - you can test by:
          1. Opening the app and clicking the layout button to cycle to "List / Details" mode
          2. Select a requirement and observe the horizontal split in the details panel
          3. Compare with "List | Details" mode which uses the traditional vertical layout

          3. Compare with "List | Details" mode which uses the traditional vertical layout

        updated the stacked detail view layout with:

          1. Resizable split - Uses egui::SidePanel with .resizable(true) for the metadata fields on the left
          2. 25%/75% default split - Metadata panel defaults to 25% width, tabs get 75%
          3. Draggable divider - You can drag the divider between the two sections to resize
          4. Min/max constraints - Metadata panel has minimum 150px and maximum 50% of available width
          5. Full tab labels - Since there's more space now, restored full tab labels like "📄 Description"
          instead of "📄 Desc"

          The GUI is running - you can test by:
          1. Switching to "List / Details" layout (stacked mode)
          2. Select a requirement
          3. Drag the vertical divider between the metadata fields and tabs to resize

  title: For Add requirement, if not title is provided use first line of description as title.
  description: |
    For Add requirement, if not title is provided use first line of description as title.If we start typing in the description and the title is
      still empty type in both the title and description until a newline is entered (limit the title to 50 characters and the put elipsis.

     Feature: Auto-Title from Description

      When adding a new requirement in the GUI:

      1. Typing in Description syncs to Title - As you type in the description field with the title empty, the first line of the description is
      automatically copied to the title field
      2. 50 character limit with ellipsis - If the first line exceeds 50 characters, it's truncated to 47 characters plus "..." (ellipsis)
      3. Stops on newline - Once you press Enter in the description (creating a new line), the auto-sync stops. This allows you to continue
      writing the full description without affecting the title.
      4. Stops on manual title edit - If you click into the title field and edit it manually, the auto-sync is disabled so your edits aren't
      overwritten.
      5. Add mode only - This behavior only applies when adding new requirements, not when editing existing ones.

      Changes made:

      - Added two state fields to track auto-sync: form_title_auto_synced and form_last_description
      - Updated clear_form() to reset auto-sync state when opening the Add form
      - Added title change detection to detect manual edits
      - Added the sync logic after the description TextEdit that:
        - Detects if description changed
        - Extracts first line
        - Truncates with ellipsis if needed
        - Stops syncing when newline is entered

      1. I created a centralized helper function sync_title_from_description(is_edit)
      2. I added calls to this function in both show_form_vertical and show_form_stacked - the two form functions that are actually used
      3. The logic:
        - Only syncs in Add mode (not Edit)
        - Only syncs while form_title_auto_synced is true
        - Only syncs while no newline has been entered
        - Truncates to 47 characters + "..." (= 50 total) if needed
        - Once a newline is entered, auto-sync is disabled

  description: Add an artifact tab to the left of History. An artifact is a file on the filesystem that we will render in this artifact tab. For a test requirement it may be a test sepecification yaml file. The goal is to have different types of artifacts that are supported for which we have the ability to render them in aida. The goal is to have something more than a simple link. Possibly it could be something we control and version if we build versioning of requirements into our model.

  title: Requirements List context menus for quick actions
  description: |+
    Requirements List context menus for quick actions
    when you press 's' in the requirements list, open a popup menu to allow you to update the status showing a menu of statuses you can up/down/enter/esc to change the current status, the current status should be selected upon popup. Likewise 'p' for priority.

    The current behavior is that it is opening the edit dialog, perhaps make this an option in the settings, but the default behavior should
      be to make the change and keep us in viewing the Details and not go into edit mode. Also, the pop-ups requirements lists quick action popups
      should probably not be active if we are in edit mode since that may be confusing.


    Requirements List hotkeys

    | key|action |
    |---|---------|
    | p | Priority pop-up |
    | s | Status pop-up |
    | j |  navigate down |
    | k | navigate up |
    | n | new sibling requirement |
    | N | new child requirement |
    | <Backspace>,<Delete> |archive requirement |
    | <Enter> |edit requirement |




    The current behavior is that it is opening the edit dialog, perhaps make this an option in the settings, but the default behavior should
      be to make the change and keep us in viewing the Details and not go into edit mode. Also, the pop-ups requirements lists quick action popups
      should probably not be active if we are in edit mode since that may be confusing.

    preventing Edit mode from triggering after a quick status change via the 's' key popup has been completed and pushed.

      Summary of the fix:
      - Added a status_popup_consumed_action flag that tracks when the status popup processes an action (Enter, Escape, click)
      - This flag is reset to false at the start of each frame
      - When the status popup handles any action, it sets this flag to true
      - The Edit keybinding handler now checks !self.status_popup_consumed_action before triggering Edit mode
      - This prevents the Enter key from being processed by both the popup (to apply the status) and the Edit handler (which would open Edit mode)

      The change has been committed with: fix: prevent Edit mode trigger after status popup selection

      You can now test by:
      1. Select a requirement in the list
      2. Press 's' to open the status popup
      3. Use arrow keys to select a status and press Enter
      4. The status should change and you should remain in the Details view (not enter Edit mode)

          be to make the change and keep us in viewing the Details and not go into edit mode. Also, the pop-ups requirements lists quick action popups
          should probably not be active if we are in edit mode since that may be confusing.

        preventing Edit mode from triggering after a quick status change via the 's' key popup has been completed and pushed.

          Summary of the fix:
          - Added a status_popup_consumed_action flag that tracks when the status popup processes an action (Enter, Escape, click)
          - This flag is reset to false at the start of each frame
          - When the status popup handles any action, it sets this flag to true
          - The Edit keybinding handler now checks !self.status_popup_consumed_action before triggering Edit mode
          - This prevents the Enter key from being processed by both the popup (to apply the status) and the Edit handler (which would open Edit mode)

          The change has been committed with: fix: prevent Edit mode trigger after status popup selection

          You can now test by:
          1. Select a requirement in the list
          2. Press 's' to open the status popup
          3. Use arrow keys to select a status and press Enter
          4. The status should change and you should remain in the Details view (not enter Edit mode)

    Status/Priority per type
    When I look at Settings/Appearance/Status Icons/Edit Icons, I see many keywords that do not correspond to our four statuses. Likewise the
      Priority Icons have more than our three. Also the ones listed are lowercase whereas the ones in the system are Captilaized first letter. I
      like this rich set of options but we may want to enable/disable the values based on requirement type. Perhaps under the Types we can have an
      edit button which will allow us to specify values for Priority and Status. Then the values shown for those fields would be based on the
      requirement type. Thoughts? We can keep the Edit Icons as is and if the status or priority matches (case insnesitive) then that will be used
      otherwise the default.

  title: Settings/Types configurating custom priorities per type
  description: |2
     Committed and pushed: 5eeb56c - feat: implement type-specific priorities in Add/Edit form

      Changes included:
      1. aida-core/src/models.rs - Added get_priorities_for_type() method to RequirementsStore (mirrors the existing get_statuses_for_type()
      pattern)
      2. aida-gui/src/app.rs - Updated the Add/Edit form:
        - Priority dropdown now uses type-specific priorities instead of hardcoded enum values
        - Priority auto-resets when changing type if current priority isn't valid for new type
        - Form uses string-based priority tracking (form_priority_string)
        - Change history properly tracks priority changes using effective_priority()
        - Save logic uses set_priority_from_str() for both new and edited requirements
      3. aida-core/src/db/sqlite_backend.rs - Added custom_priority: None placeholder (for when database column is added)

      The type-specific priorities feature is now fully integrated:
      - Quick-change popup ('p' key) shows type-specific priorities
      - Add/Edit form dropdown shows type-specific priorities
      - Settings > Types allows configuring custom priorities per type

    AI integration
    I want to integrate AI and probably claude code into this application. The first baby step would be to have in the
      Actions dropdown an AI subdropdown menu with actions we can take. Consider if we should evaluate the current requirement, perhaps we provide
      the entire database as context (for the moment) and it can discern whether the requirement is well written, suggest updates, consider
      duplicates, whether references or other relationships should be created etc. Our goal is to make this application like an editor which is
      fast, and nimble without a lot os fluff and primarily driven by the keyboard in preference to the mouse. we want to move fast, iterating
      frequently with the goal of this becoming self-referential whereby we are able to start feeding back into claude code requirements that
      improve the application itself. Perhaps you should review requirements.yaml itself for inspiration.

  title: AI Requirement Evaluation
  description: |2+
     I've implemented a complete background AI evaluation system for AIDA with the following components:

      1. StoredAiEvaluation (aida-core/src/ai/responses.rs)

      - Wraps evaluation results with metadata (timestamp, content hash)
      - Provides new() and is_stale() methods for staleness detection

      2. Requirement Model Updates (aida-core/src/models.rs)

      - Added ai_evaluation: Option<StoredAiEvaluation> field
      - Added content_hash() method using DefaultHasher on title, description, and type
      - Added needs_ai_evaluation() method to check if evaluation is needed

      3. AI Tab in GUI (aida-gui/src/app.rs)

      - Added Ai variant to DetailTab enum
      - Added AI tab to the left of Description in both layout modes
      - Tab shows status indicators: "🤖 AI" (no eval), "🤖 AI ✓" (current), "🤖 AI ⚠️" (stale)
      - Created show_ai_tab() method displaying:
        - Quality score with color-coded progress bar (green/amber/red)
        - Evaluation timestamp and staleness warning
        - Collapsible sections for strengths, issues, and suggested improvements
        - Placeholder message when no evaluation exists

      4. BackgroundEvaluator Service (aida-core/src/ai/evaluator.rs)

      - Runs in a separate thread scanning for requirements needing evaluation
      - Supports commands: Pause, Resume, Stop, PrioritizeRequirement, ScanForWork
      - Configurable delays between evaluations and idle scans
      - Priority queue for manually triggered evaluations
      - Rate limiting protection with backoff on errors
      - Results communicated back via channel for GUI to apply

      The system is designed to:
      - Evaluate requirements one-by-one in the background
      - Track evaluation staleness via content hashing
      - Allow manual triggering via Actions → AI → Evaluate
      - Display cached results immediately in the AI tab

  description: |-
    Support Attachments

    Support file attachments for requirements with the following capabilities:

    **Storage:**
    - Store attachments on the filesystem in a project-specific attachments directory
    - Support common file types: images (PNG, JPG, GIF), documents (PDF, TXT, MD), and archives (ZIP)
    - Maximum file size: 10MB per attachment (settings allow set limits)
    - Maximum attachments per requirement: 10 (settings allow set limits)
    - Settings allow command line specification for a file type with '{{path}}' as a substitution pattern for the attachment path. (Support other metadata field substitutions based on field name (case insensitive) {{id}} for id etc.

    **User Interface:**
    - Display attachments as a list showing filename, size, and type icon
    - Double-click attachment to open with the system's default application
    - Provide add, delete, and download attachment buttons
    - Show error message if the operating system cannot open the file type

    **Data Management:**
    - Include attachment metadata in exports (filename, size, hash)
    - Optionally include attachment files in export archives
    - Maintain referential integrity when requirements are deleted (prompt to delete or orphan attachments)

I am worried about long running commands and if I close the gui I would want to detach the command execution probably and not have the command killed. Maybe we will want to see the history of command execution but we can worry about that later, maybe an Action could be to view a markdown report of the history of command execution so that it is not mixed with the rest of the requirement history.

    Apply button for suggested improved description

    Apply button for AI suggested description improvements. Here's a summary of the changes:

      Feature implemented:
      - Added an "✓ Apply Improved Description" button in the AI Evaluation tab's Suggested Improvements section
      - When clicked, it replaces the current requirement description with the AI-suggested improvement
      - The change is tracked in the requirement's history (including old and new values, author, and timestamp)
      - A toast notification confirms the action: "Applied AI improvement to [spec_id]"

      Technical changes in aida-gui/src/app.rs:
      1. Added pending_apply_ai_description: Option<(Uuid, String)> field to the app struct for deferred mutation
      2. Modified show_ai_tab() to accept req_id: Uuid parameter and updated both call sites
      3. Added the Apply button in the suggested improvements section (lines 11303-11311)
      4. Added handler for pending_apply_ai_description in the update loop (line 15647)
      5. Added apply_ai_description() method (lines 8128-8168) that:
        - Updates the description directly
        - Updates modified_at timestamp
        - Adds a HistoryEntry with the field change
        - Saves the store
        - Shows a toast notification

    AI Implement Button

    "Copy for Claude Code" feature. Here's a summary of what was done:

      Implementation Complete

      Added a new button "Copy for Claude Code" in the Actions → AI submenu that:

      1. Location: Appears at the bottom of the AI submenu (after a separator), making it easy to find
        - Path: Actions → AI → Copy for Claude Code
      2. Availability: Only enabled when the requirement has status "Approved"
        - Shows a helpful tooltip when disabled: "Requirement must be Approved to implement"
      3. Formatted Output: When clicked, copies a well-structured prompt to clipboard including:
        - Requirement ID and title
        - Type, Priority, and Feature
        - Full description
        - Tags (if any)
        - Implementation instructions with guidance on:
            - Following project patterns
          - Adding tests
          - Updating status when done
      4. User Feedback: Shows a toast notification confirming the copy with the requirement ID
      5. Linux Support: Also copies to the PRIMARY selection for middle-click paste

      Example Output

      When you click "Copy for Claude Code" on an approved requirement, this gets copied to your clipboard:

      # Implement Requirement: FR-0001 - User Authentication

      ## Implementation Task

      Please implement this requirement in the codebase. After implementation:
      1. Ensure the code follows the project's existing patterns and style
      2. Add appropriate tests if applicable
      3. Update the requirement status to 'Completed' when done

  title: AI Find Duplicates
  description: |
    AI Find Duplicates

     "Find Duplicates" run in the background is valid and well-justified:

      1. Current behavior: The AiAction::FindDuplicates handler in aida-gui/src/app.rs:11064-11094 runs synchronously, calling
      self.ai_client.find_duplicates() on the main thread. This blocks the UI while waiting for the AI API response.
      2. Existing pattern: The "Evaluate Requirement" action already implements background processing using:
        - A BackgroundAiResult struct to hold async results
        - An ai_eval_receiver channel to receive results from the background thread
        - Spawning a std::thread with an mpsc::channel for communication
      3. User impact: AI API calls can take several seconds, making the UI freeze unacceptable for good UX.

      What Was Done

      1. Added requirement FR-0148 "Background AI Find Duplicates":
        - Title: "Background AI Find Duplicates"
        - Description: The AI 'Find Duplicates' action shall run in a background thread (similar to 'Evaluate Requirement') to avoid blocking the
      UI. Results shall be stored in the AI Evaluation panel. When duplicates are found, an 'Execute Suggestion' button shall be provided to take
      action on the results.
        - Type: Functional, Priority: Medium, Feature: 6-AI-Integration, Status: Draft
      2. Updated REQUIREMENTS.md with new Section 12 "AI Integration" covering:
        - AI Actions (REQ-AI-001 through REQ-AI-006)
        - Background Processing (REQ-AI-007 through REQ-AI-010)
        - Claude Code Integration (REQ-AI-011, REQ-AI-012)
      3. Updated PROMPT_HISTORY.md with:
        - Copy for Claude Code feature entry
        - Background AI Find Duplicates requirement entry

    ## Stale Data Protection for YAML Database

    The system shall implement optimistic concurrency control to prevent data loss when multiple tools (AIDA GUI/CLI, Claude Code) access the requirements database concurrently.

    ### Requirements

    1. **Freshness Check**: The system shall store a `modified_at` timestamp for each requirement and reload the database immediately before applying any update.

    2. **Conflict Detection**: Before saving a requirement update, the system shall compare the `modified_at` timestamp of the in-memory requirement with the on-disk version:
       - If timestamps match, proceed with the update
       - If on-disk is newer, a conflict exists

    3. **Field-Level Conflict Resolution**: When a conflict is detected, the system shall:
       - Compare only the fields being modified
       - If modified fields are unchanged on disk, merge and proceed
       - If modified fields differ, notify the user of the conflict

    4. **User Notification**: On conflict, the system shall display the conflicting changes and offer options to:
       - Reload and discard local changes
       - Force overwrite (with warning)
       - Manually merge changes

    ### Acceptance Criteria

    - [x] Concurrent edits from AIDA GUI and Claude Code do not silently overwrite each other
    - [x] User is notified when their edit conflicts with external changes
    - [x] Non-conflicting concurrent edits to different requirements are preserved
    - [x] Non-conflicting edits to different fields of the same requirement are merged

  description: |2-


      Implemented optimistic concurrency control for the YAML database with the following features:

      Storage Layer (aida-core/src/storage.rs):
      - Added conflict detection types: ConflictInfo, FieldConflict, SaveResult, ConflictResolution
      - save_with_conflict_detection() - reloads database before saving, compares timestamps
      - detect_field_conflicts() - compares 8 key fields (title, description, status, priority, owner, feature, type, tags)
      - merge_requirement() - intelligently merges non-conflicting changes
      - save_with_resolution() - handles user's conflict resolution choice
      - 6 unit tests covering all scenarios

      GUI (aida-gui/src/app.rs):
      - Tracks original timestamps at load time
      - Tracks which requirements have been modified locally
      - Conflict resolution dialog showing field-by-field comparison
      - Three resolution options: "Use My Changes", "Use Disk Version", "Merge (Keep Non-Conflicting)"

    Support disconnected mode

    When the database is not available, be able to update requiremetns locally and provide a mechanism to sync the changes. For example, we could have a patch file of operations that we performed and then play those operations back when we sync with the mothership.

  description: |-
    ## Collaborative Session Tracking

    The system shall track active user sessions to provide awareness when multiple users (GUI instances, CLI, Claude Code) access the same requirements file concurrently.

    ### Requirements

    1. **Session Registration**: Each GUI instance shall register itself in the lock file on startup with:
       - Unique session ID (PID + UUID)
       - User name/handle
       - Hostname
       - Process ID
       - Start timestamp

    2. **Heartbeat Thread**: A background thread shall update the lock file every 5 seconds to indicate the session is still active

    3. **Edit Lock Tracking**: When entering edit mode, the system shall record:
       - Which requirement is being edited
       - When editing started
       - The user editing it

    4. **Stale Session Cleanup**: Sessions without heartbeat for 30 seconds shall be automatically removed

    5. **Concurrent User Warning**: Display a toast notification when:
       - Another user has the file open (shown once per session)
       - Entering edit mode on a requirement someone else is currently editing

    6. **Session Unregistration**: On application close, the session shall be removed from the lock file

    ### Lock File Format

    The lock file shall use YAML format containing all active sessions with their details.

    ### Acceptance Criteria

    - [x] Sessions are registered on startup
    - [x] Heartbeat updates every 5 seconds
    - [x] Edit locks are tracked when entering edit mode
    - [x] Stale sessions are cleaned up automatically
    - [x] Toast warnings shown for concurrent users
    - [x] Sessions unregistered on shutdown

  title: Scaffolding generates AIDA-aware CLAUDE.md with /aida-capture skill
  description: |2
      Implemented (FR-0168)

      1. Updated Scaffolding CLAUDE.md

      The generated CLAUDE.md now includes:

      Requirements Management Section:
      - Explicit instruction: "Do NOT maintain a separate REQUIREMENTS.md file"
      - CLI commands reference (list, show, add, edit, comment)
      - During Development guidelines (update status, add comments, create child reqs)
      - Session workflow guidance pointing to /aida-capture

      Updated Skills Section:
      - /aida-req - Add new requirements
      - /aida-implement - Implement with traceability
      - /aida-capture - Session-end review (new)

      2. Created /aida-capture Skill

      Located at .claude/skills/aida-capture.md:

      - Purpose: Safety net for conversational workflows
      - When: End of session, or when working without explicit /aida-req calls
      - What it does:
        a. Scans conversation for implemented features/fixes
        b. Checks against requirements database
        c. Presents summary: Missing, Outdated, Already Captured
        d. Prompts user to add/update requirements
        e. Executes captures with aida CLI
