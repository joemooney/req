# Standard AI Prompts Template
# This template provides a comprehensive set of AI prompt configurations
# for requirements management projects. It includes:
# - Support for questions/ideas that need to be transformed into formal requirements
# - Markdown formatting requirements
# - Type-specific guidance for Functional, NonFunctional, User, System, and ChangeRequest types

    This is a requirements management system for a software project. Requirements may be entered as:
    - Formal requirements with clear "shall" or "must" statements
    - Questions or ideas that need to be transformed into formal requirements
    - Rough notes that need refinement

    When evaluating or improving requirements:
    - Descriptions should be formatted in Markdown
    - Use bullet points for lists of criteria or acceptance conditions
    - Use code blocks for any technical specifications
    - Formal requirements should use "shall" or "must" language
    - If the input is a question or idea, help transform it into one or more actionable requirements
    - If the input doesn't represent a valid requirement and cannot be transformed, indicate it should be rejected or clarified

  evaluation:
    additional_instructions: |
      When scoring quality, consider:
      - If the description is a question/idea rather than a formal requirement, note this and suggest how to formalize it
      - Check if the requirement is testable and verifiable
      - Ensure the description uses proper Markdown formatting
      - Flag requirements that are too vague or broad to implement
      - Suggest splitting requirements that contain multiple distinct features

      For issues, specifically flag:
      - Missing acceptance criteria
      - Ambiguous language (avoid "should", prefer "shall/must")
      - Requirements that are actually questions needing answers
      - Missing stakeholder or user context

      When improving descriptions:
      - Convert the output to well-formatted Markdown
      - If the input is a question or rough idea, transform it into a formal requirement statement
      - Use "The system shall..." or "The user must be able to..." phrasing
      - Add acceptance criteria as a Markdown bulleted list under "### Acceptance Criteria"
      - Include any assumptions under "### Assumptions" if relevant
      - If the requirement cannot be formalized (too vague, out of scope, or not a requirement), explain why and suggest next steps

      Example format for improved description:
      The system shall [action] [object] [condition].

      ### Acceptance Criteria
      - Criterion 1
      - Criterion 2

      ### Assumptions
      - Assumption if applicable

  generate_children:
    additional_instructions: |
      When generating child requirements:
      - Each child requirement description should be in Markdown format
      - Break down the parent into specific, implementable pieces
      - If the parent is a question or idea, generate formal child requirements that answer/implement it
      - Each child should be independently testable
      - Include acceptance criteria for each child
      - Suggest appropriate types (Functional, NonFunctional, System, User) for each child

  type_prompts:
    - type_name: Functional
      evaluation_extra: |
        Functional requirements should describe specific system behaviors.
        - Use "The system shall..." format
        - Include input/output specifications where applicable
        - Describe the expected behavior, not implementation details
        - Add acceptance criteria that can be verified through testing
      improve_extra: |
        Functional requirements should describe specific system behaviors.
        - Use "The system shall..." format
        - Include input/output specifications where applicable
        - Describe the expected behavior, not implementation details
        - Add acceptance criteria that can be verified through testing

    - type_name: NonFunctional
      evaluation_extra: |
        Non-functional requirements should specify measurable quality attributes.
        - Include specific metrics (response time < 200ms, 99.9% uptime, etc.)
        - Reference industry standards where applicable (WCAG, ISO, etc.)
        - Describe how compliance will be measured/verified
        - Consider performance, security, scalability, accessibility, reliability

    - type_name: User
      evaluation_extra: |
        User requirements should focus on user needs and goals.
        - Describe from the user's perspective ("As a user, I need to...")
        - Include user context and motivation
        - Focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how"
        - Consider different user personas if applicable

        User requirements should focus on user needs and goals.

    - type_name: System
      evaluation_extra: |
        System requirements should describe technical constraints and interfaces.
        - Specify integration points and protocols
        - Include data formats and API contracts where relevant
        - Reference external systems and dependencies
        - Use technical terminology appropriate for the domain

    - type_name: ChangeRequest
      evaluation_extra: |
        Change requests should clearly describe what needs to change and why.
        - Identify the current behavior and desired behavior
        - Include justification and impact assessment
        - Reference related requirements that will be affected
