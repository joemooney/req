### User Meta-Type with $USER-XXX IDs
- **Prompt**: I want a User object type to manage users. A user will have relationships with requirements. A requirement could be created-by, assigned-to, tested-by, closed-by. Since this is a special type, I propose having a prefix '$USER' and its own sequence number starting at one. We will have other special types that start with '$'. For example, Views, Features, and other metatypes can have their own id.

    - `created_by` - User who created the requirement (N:1, blue)
    - `assigned_to` - User assigned to work on requirement (N:1, green)
    - `tested_by` - User who tested/verified requirement (N:N, orange)
    - `closed_by` - User who closed/completed requirement (N:1, red)
  - Updated GUI users table to show spec_id column with blue highlighting
  - Updated `add_new_user()` to use `add_user_with_id()` for auto-generated IDs
  - Added automatic migration in storage.rs to assign $USER-XXX IDs on load
  - Exported meta prefix constants from requirements-core lib.rs

## Session 7: Custom Type Definitions (2025-11-26)

### Custom Type Definitions System
- **Prompt**: Add support for different requirement types with type-specific statuses and custom fields
- **Problem**: Change Requests need different statuses (Submitted, Under Review, In Progress, etc.) than standard requirements. May also need additional fields specific to the type.
- **Solution**: Implemented a hybrid approach with configurable type definitions stored in requirements.yaml
- **Actions**:
  - Added `CustomFieldType` enum (Text, TextArea, Select, Boolean, Date, User, Requirement, Number)

  - Added `custom_fields: HashMap<String, String>` to Requirement for type-specific fields
  - Added helper methods: `effective_status()`, `set_status_from_str()`, `get_type_definition()`, `get_statuses_for_type()`, `get_custom_fields_for_type()`
  - ChangeRequest type now has custom statuses: Draft, Submitted, Under Review, Approved, Rejected, In Progress, Implemented, Verified, Closed
  - ChangeRequest type has custom fields: impact (select), requested_by (user ref), target_release (text), justification (textarea)

### GUI Updates for Custom Types

  - Updated form to use type-specific status dropdown
  - Added `form_status_string` and `form_custom_fields` to track form state
  - When type changes, status dropdown updates to show type-specific statuses

### ID Prefix Filtering and Management (continued)
- **Prompt**: Add prefix filtering to the GUI and prefix management in admin settings
- **Problem**: Users wanted to filter requirements by their ID prefix (e.g., show only SEC-xxx or API-xxx requirements). Also wanted admin control over which prefixes are allowed.
- **Solution**: Added prefix registry to RequirementsStore with filter support and admin management
- **Actions**:
  - Added `allowed_prefixes: Vec<String>` to RequirementsStore - list of allowed/known prefixes
  - Added `restrict_prefixes: bool` - when true, users must select from allowed list
  - Added `get_used_prefixes()` - gets all unique prefixes currently in use
  - Added `get_all_prefixes()` - combines allowed + used prefixes
  - Added `add_allowed_prefix()`, `remove_allowed_prefix()`, `is_prefix_allowed()` helper methods
  - Added `filter_prefixes: HashSet<String>` to GUI app for prefix filtering
  - Updated ViewPreset to include prefix filters
  - Updated `passes_filters()` to check prefix filter
  - Added "ID Prefix Filters" section to filter panel (shows checkboxes for each unique prefix)
  - Added "ID Prefix Management" section to Admin settings tab:
    - Toggle to restrict prefixes to allowed list
    - Shows prefixes currently in use
    - Add new allowed prefixes
    - Remove prefixes from allowed list
  - Updated add/edit form to show dropdown when prefixes are restricted, text input otherwise
  - Auto-add new prefixes to allowed list when used (unless restricted)
  - Updated documentation with Prefix Management section

### Two-Level Filter System (Root/Children)
- **Prompt**: "I think in filtering it may be worth having two levels. So when you click Filters you get two tabs, one for root and one for children. The root option filters the first level of requirements that are selected, and the children applies to which children are shown recursively. In children there is a checkbox, <same as root> which greys out everything or hides them (that would be the same as what we currently have, one set of filters across all requirements). The purpose of this is to limit the scope of the top level requirements that we want to drill down into."
- **Problem**: Users wanted to filter root-level requirements differently from children in hierarchical views. For example, show only Functional Requirements at root level, but display all their children regardless of type.
- **Solution**: Implemented two-level filtering with separate filter sets for root and children, with "Same as root" option to use unified filters.
- **Actions**:
  - Added `FilterTab` enum (Root, Children) for tab selection
  - Added child filter fields to RequirementsApp:
    - `child_filter_types: HashSet<RequirementType>`
    - `child_filter_features: HashSet<String>`
    - `child_filter_prefixes: HashSet<String>`
    - `children_same_as_root: bool` (defaults to true)
    - `filter_tab: FilterTab` for active tab state
  - Updated ViewPreset struct with child filter fields and `children_same_as_root`
  - Updated `apply_preset()` to restore child filter state
  - Updated `save_current_view_as_preset()` to save child filters
  - Updated `current_view_matches_active_preset()` to compare child filters
  - Updated `has_unsaved_view()` to detect child filter changes
  - Refactored `show_filter_controls()` to display Root/Children tabs
  - Added `show_root_filter_controls()` for root-level filters
  - Added `show_children_filter_controls()` with "Same as root" checkbox that disables child filters when checked
  - Updated `passes_filters()` to accept `is_root: bool` parameter:
    - Root requirements use root filters
    - Child requirements use child filters (or root filters if `children_same_as_root` is true)
  - Updated all callers of `passes_filters()`:
    - `find_tree_roots()` and `find_tree_leaves()` - is_root=true
    - `get_children()` and `get_parents()` - is_root=false
    - Flat list views - is_root=true (all at same level)
  - Updated user-guide.md with "Filtering Requirements" section
  - Updated OVERVIEW.md with two-level filtering in GUI features

### Type Definition Editor

    - `editing_field_idx: Option<usize>` - index of field being edited
    - `field_form_*` fields for name, label, type, required, options, default
    - `show_field_form: bool` - toggle field form visibility
  - Refactored `show_settings_type_definitions_tab()`:
    - Added "➕ Add New Type" button
    - Each type shows edit (✏), reset (↺ for built-in), and delete (🗑 for custom) buttons

### Navigation Keybindings Bug Fix
- **Prompt**: "When I am add/edit and I start editing the description and I press the up arrow, I think the global key binding is being invoked to move to the previous requirement"
- **Root Cause**: User's saved settings (`~/.requirements_gui_settings.yaml`) had NavigateUp/NavigateDown keybindings with `Global` context instead of `RequirementsList`
- **Solution**: Fixed context determination in keybinding evaluation; user should delete saved settings to reset keybindings
- **Actions**:
  - Changed keybinding context to `KeyContext::Form` when in form view or settings
  - Added debug prints to diagnose the issue
  - Confirmed the bug was due to persisted settings with wrong context values

### External URL Links Feature
- **Prompt**: "When you click on Links tab, beside Relationships show a New URL button, in the modal perhaps a button to verify that it is a valid link."
- **Solution**: Added external URL links to requirements with validation support

  - Exported `UrlLink` from requirements-core/src/lib.rs
  - Added dependencies to requirements-gui/Cargo.toml:
    - `url = "2"` for URL parsing/validation
    - `open = "5"` for opening URLs in browser
  - Added URL form state fields to RequirementsApp:
    - `show_url_form`, `editing_url_id`, `url_form_url`, `url_form_title`, `url_form_description`
    - `url_verification_status`, `url_verification_in_progress`
  - Updated `show_links_tab()`:

- **Solution**: Added configurable title bar styling with themed backgrounds
- **Actions**:
  - Added to CustomTheme struct:
    - `title_bar_bg: ThemeColor` - background color
    - `title_bar_text: Option<ThemeColor>` - optional text color override
    - `title_bar_font_size: f32` - font size multiplier (default 1.0)
  - Added defaults for dark theme: RGB(45, 45, 50) - slightly lighter than panel
  - Added defaults for light theme: RGB(220, 220, 225) - slightly darker than panel
  - Added helper methods to Theme enum:
    - `title_bar_bg()` - returns appropriate background for theme
    - `title_bar_text()` - returns optional text color
    - `title_bar_font_size()` - returns font size multiplier
  - Refactored title bar in `show_detail_view_internal()`:
    - Wrapped in `egui::Frame::none()` with styled background
    - Applied `.fill()`, `.inner_margin()`, and `.rounding()`
    - Changed `ui.heading()` to `ui.label()` with `egui::RichText`

    - SolarizedDark: RGB(7, 54, 66) (base02)
    - Nord: RGB(59, 66, 82) (nord1)

### Stacked Layout Content Clipping Fix
- **Prompt**: "In the horizontal stacked layout the Details View layout is being clipped after the first line"
- **Root Cause**: The `SidePanel` and `CentralPanel` for the stacked detail view were wrapped in `ui.horizontal()`, which constrains height to a single row
- **Solution**: Removed the `ui.horizontal()` wrapper; panels position themselves side-by-side naturally
- **Actions**:
  - Removed `ui.horizontal(|ui| { ... });` wrapper around the panels
  - Fixed indentation of the SidePanel and CentralPanel code
  - Panels now use full available height in the stacked detail view

### Developer's Guide Documentation
- **Prompt**: "We have a very nice set of layouts... I need a comprehensive write up on our architecture and implementation"
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive Developer's Guide at `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- **Contents**:
  - Project overview and technology stack
  - Project structure (workspace, crates, modules)
  - Core data model (Requirement, RequirementsStore, relationships)
  - GUI architecture (RequirementsApp, Views, update loop)
  - Layout system (5 layout modes with implementation patterns)
  - Theme system (built-in themes, CustomTheme structure)

  - Code patterns and conventions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Appendices with file locations and line number references

### Edit/Add Form Redesign
- **Prompt**: "I really like the Details View layout and wonder if we could reuse/mimic it for the Edit/Add view"
- **Solution**: Created new `show_form_stacked()` function that mirrors the Detail View layout
- **Layout Design**:
  - **Title Bar**: Styled header with editable title field, Save/Cancel buttons, and mode indicator (New/Edit)
  - **Left Panel** (25% default width, resizable): Metadata fields in a grid
    - ID (edit mode only)
    - Prefix dropdown/textbox (respects restrict_prefixes setting)
    - Type dropdown (Functional, NonFunctional, System, User, ChangeRequest, Bug, Epic, Story, Task, Spike)
    - Status dropdown (dynamically based on type's allowed statuses)
    - Priority dropdown (High, Medium, Low)
    - Feature text field
    - Owner text field
    - Tags text field (comma-separated)
    - Parent (new requirements only, if set)
    - Custom fields section (type-specific fields)
  - **Right Panel** (75%, remaining space): Description editor
    - Header with Preview/Edit toggle and Markdown help link
    - Full-height text editor or markdown preview
- **Features**:
  - Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+S to save, ESC to cancel
  - Cancel confirmation dialog for unsaved changes
  - Context menu support for text fields
  - Type change resets status to first valid status
  - Custom fields support all field types (Text, TextArea, Select, Boolean, Number, Date, User, Requirement)
- **Helper Functions**:
  - `show_prefix_field()` - Reusable prefix dropdown/text input
  - `show_custom_field_editor()` - Reusable custom field renderer for all field types

### Layout-Aware Form Views
- **Prompt**: "The layout for the edit should match the layout we are currently viewing"
- **Solution**: Form layout now adapts based on current view mode
- **Implementation**:
  - `show_form_vertical()` - For List|Details (side-by-side) view:
    - Metadata grid at top (matching Detail View vertical layout)
    - Description editor at bottom with scroll
  - `show_form_stacked()` - For List/Details Stacked view:
    - Metadata on left (25% resizable panel)
    - Description on right (75% remaining space)
  - Form selection logic at call site:
    - `LayoutMode::ListDetailsStacked` → `show_form_stacked()`
    - All other modes → `show_form_vertical()`
- **Both layouts share**:
  - Styled title bar with editable title field
  - Save/Cancel buttons with keyboard shortcuts
  - All metadata fields as dropdowns
  - Description editor with markdown preview toggle
  - Custom fields support
  - Cancel confirmation dialog

### Seamless Detail-to-Edit View Transition
- **Prompt**: "When we switch to Edit we should not adjust the relative width of the panels, the Details View and the Edit View should remain the same width - it is a little jarring to jump in size. Also the font size for the title should remain the same. No need to have the word 'Edit' to the right of the textbox for the title during edit, and make the title textbox is not expanding to use all available width, we should do that."
- **Solution**: Made transitions between Detail View and Edit View seamless
- **Changes to both `show_form_vertical()` and `show_form_stacked()`**:
  1. **Title font size**: Changed from `egui::TextStyle::Heading` to `egui::FontId::proportional(18.0 * title_bar_font_size)` to match Detail View exactly
  2. **Title width**: Changed from `available_width * 0.6` to `(available - button_space).max(200.0)` where `button_space = 180.0`, making title expand to use all available width
  3. **Removed mode indicator**: Removed the "Edit"/"New" label that appeared next to the title, reducing visual clutter
- **Result**: Switching between Detail View and Edit View now feels seamless with consistent sizing and appearance

### Simplified List Panel in Edit View
- **Prompt**: User feedback via screenshots showing list panel width jump when entering Edit view - expanded filter bar with View/Perspective/Direction controls was making the list panel much wider in Edit mode compared to Detail mode
- **Root Cause**: Edit view was using `show_list_panel()` which includes expanded filter bar (Hide, Filters, View, Parent/Child, Top-down, Save As, refresh). Detail view only shows simple search + filter button.
- **Solution**: Created `show_list_panel_simple()` function
- **Implementation**:
  - New function `show_list_panel_simple()` (lines 9268-9327) with simplified content:
    - Header with Hide button
    - Search bar with Search... hint (120.0 width to match Detail View)
    - Filter dropdown button only
    - Scrollable list
  - No perspective/preset/direction controls (these made panel wider)
  - Changed form view to use `show_list_panel_simple()` instead of `show_list_panel()`
- **Result**: List panel now maintains consistent width when switching between Detail and Edit views

### List Panel Max Width Constraint
- **Prompt**: User feedback showing list panel in Edit view auto-expanding to fit long requirement titles (e.g., "REQ-0090 - Arrow keys bad behavior in edit mode123456789...")
- **Root Cause**: `SidePanel::left()` with `.resizable(true)` auto-expands to fit content width. The long title in the list was causing the panel to grow beyond desired bounds.
- **Solution**: Added `max_width` constraint to `show_list_panel_simple()`
- **Implementation**:
  - Calculate `max_panel_width` as 50% of screen width (minimum 350.0)
  - Added `.max_width(max_panel_width)` to the SidePanel configuration
  - Content is now clipped/truncated rather than expanding the panel
- **Result**: List panel stays within bounds even with long requirement titles

### Details View Title Truncation
- **Prompt**: "In the Details view the title needs to be truncated so that the Actions and Edit buttons remain visible"
- **Root Cause**: The title label in `show_detail_view_internal()` was rendered first without width constraints, causing it to push the Actions/Edit/Close buttons off-screen when titles were very long.
- **Solution**: Constrain title width to reserve space for buttons
- **Implementation** (in `show_detail_view_internal()` around line 9635):
  - Calculate reserved `buttons_width` (220px with Close button, 180px without)
  - Calculate `title_max_width = (available_width - buttons_width).max(100.0)`
  - Use `allocate_ui_with_layout()` to create constrained space for title
  - Apply `ui.set_clip_rect()` to prevent overflow
  - Use `egui::Label::new(title_text).truncate()` to truncate with ellipsis
- **Result**: Long titles are now truncated with ellipsis, keeping Actions, Edit, and Close buttons visible

### Edit View Layout Gap Fix (ListDetailsSide Mode)
- **Prompt**: User screenshot showing black gap between list panel and Edit form panel
- **Root Cause**: Architectural mismatch between Detail View and Edit View layouts:
  - Detail View used `CentralPanel` with `ui.columns(2, ...)` for 50/50 split
  - Edit View used `SidePanel::left("list_panel_simple")` + `CentralPanel` - different approach!
  - The different panel IDs and layout mechanisms caused a visual gap
- **Solution**: Make Edit View use identical layout approach as Detail View for `ListDetailsSide` mode
- **Implementation** (in form view code around line 13983):
  - For `ListDetailsSide`: Use `CentralPanel` with `ui.columns(2, ...)` for Edit/Add views
  - Left column renders list content (search bar, filter button, tree list)
  - Right column renders the form via `show_form_vertical()`
  - Uses same scroll area ID (`"list_side_scroll"`) as Detail View for consistency
  - Other layout modes (ListDetailsStacked, SplitListDetails, etc.) continue using SidePanel
- **Result**: Seamless transition between Detail View and Edit View with no visual gaps

### Edit View Layout Fix (ListDetailsStacked Mode)
- **Prompt**: User screenshots showing stacked layout Edit view was using wrong panel arrangement - list on LEFT instead of on TOP
- **Root Cause**: Edit View for `ListDetailsStacked` was using `SidePanel` (list on left) + `CentralPanel` approach, but Detail View uses `TopBottomPanel` (list on top) + `CentralPanel`
- **Solution**: Make Edit View use `TopBottomPanel` for `ListDetailsStacked` mode
- **Implementation** (in form view code around line 14044):
  - For `ListDetailsStacked`: Use `TopBottomPanel::top("list_top_panel")` for list
  - Same panel ID, min_height, default_height, and resizable settings as Detail View
  - List panel has search bar, filter button, scrollable tree list
  - `CentralPanel` below contains the form via `show_form_stacked()`
- **Result**: Edit View in stacked mode now matches Detail View with list on top, form on bottom

### User-Defined Theme Files
- **Prompt**: "Should there be a default aida_gui_settings.yaml that we keep in git?" / "yes that sounds good to implement user-defined theme files and Keep the built-in themes compiled in as fallbacks"
- **Solution**: Added support for loading custom themes from `~/.config/aida/themes/` directory
- **Implementation** (in `app.rs`):
  - New helper function `themes_dir()` returns and creates `~/.config/aida/themes/` directory
  - `load_file_themes()` scans the themes directory for `.yaml`/`.yml` files and deserializes them
  - `save_theme_to_file()` exports a theme as a YAML file to the themes directory
  - Modified `UserSettings::load()` to merge file-based themes with embedded themes
  - Added "Export to File" button in Theme Editor to save current theme to a file
- **Result**: Users can now create, export, and share custom themes as YAML files. Built-in themes remain compiled in as fallbacks.

### Modal Window Size Constraints
- **Prompt**: "Modals should not be taller or wider than the window. We should use scrollbars (as needed) so that we never exceed a certain percentage of window height and width. The markdown Help for example can be very tall."
- **Solution**: Added helper functions and constraints to limit modal windows to 90% width and 85% height of the main window
- **Implementation** (in `app.rs`):
  - Added constants `MODAL_MAX_WIDTH_PERCENT` (0.90) and `MODAL_MAX_HEIGHT_PERCENT` (0.85)
  - New helper function `modal_max_size(ctx)` calculates max dimensions from screen rect
  - New helper function `constrained_modal_size(ctx, width, height)` clamps sizes to max
  - Updated modals to use `.max_width()`, `.max_height()`, and `.scroll()`:
    - Markdown Help modal
    - Settings dialog
    - Theme Editor
    - Switch Project dialog
    - New Project dialog
    - Status & Priority Icons dialog
    - View Settings (List 1 and List 2)
- **Result**: All modal windows now respect window boundaries and show scrollbars when content exceeds available space
